## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

StylableUIKit is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'StylableUIKit'
```

## Running tests

The tests are mostly UI based, so you have to run them on an iPhone 8+, iOS 12.2 or the slight variation will break the image comparisons.
